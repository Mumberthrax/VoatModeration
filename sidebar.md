voat:  - have your say



because reddit is cancer


-----------------------
This is place for critical discussion and fun.  It isn't a place for naked worship of a website.

Posts should be relevant to voat.  This can include 

* highlights of  original content or drama from voat in the same way r/4chan serves a taste of that website.

* technical glitches when accessing voat.co

* Posts describing what reddit is saying about voat whether it is very smart or very wrong.  

* Posts that critically discuss the structure and administration of voat and how it is similar or different to reddit.  

* Complaints about voat censorship, moderation, adminstration and injustice.  

* Ideas for reddit based on experience drawn from voat.

It is worth remembering that voat is just a student side project.   Despite what some users claim, it is an experiment rather than a promise of a better reddit.
