If you want something new just pull-request it


###Noob Guide (simple/plain language, straightforward practical instructions):

Github works like this: one person or group of people is in charge of the main thingy. Other people can make a copy of that thingy, make changes, then make a "pull-request" to have that changed copy mixed back into the main thingy. If the original owner approves it, then the changes are made official.

Simplest way to contribute is to click on a specific file you want to change, then click the little icon with a pen on it labelled edit, change what you want, add a comment below about what you changed, and click "propose file change"

Pretty simple.

Other ways to do this are more complex, but let you change multiple files at the same time. Some info accessible here: https://help.github.com/
